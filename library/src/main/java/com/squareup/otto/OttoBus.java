/**
 * Interface for event bus implementations, which dispatch events to listeners and provide ways for listeners to
 * register themselves.
 *
 * <p>A class implementing this interface (henceforth, a "bus") allows publish-subscribe-style communication between
 * components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each
 * other).  This is designed exclusively to replace traditional Android in-process event distribution using explicit
 * registration or listeners. It is <em>not</em> a general-purpose publish-subscribe system, nor is it intended for
 * interprocess communication.
 *
 * <h2>Receiving Events</h2>
 * To receive events, an object should:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Expose a public method, known as the <i>event handler</i>, which accepts a single argument of the type of event
 * desired;</li>
 * <li>Mark it with a {@link com.squareup.otto.Subscribe} annotation;</li>
 * <li>Pass itself to the bus' {@link #register(Object)} method.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Posting Events</h2>
 * To post an event, simply provide the event object to the bus' {@link #post(Object)} method.  The bus will
 * determine the type of event and route it to all registered listeners.
 *
 * <p>Events are routed based on their type &mdash; an event will be delivered to any handler for any type to which the
 * event is <em>assignable.</em>  This includes implemented interfaces, all superclasses, and all interfaces implemented
 * by superclasses.
 *
 * <p>When {@code post} is called, all registered handlers for an event are run in sequence, so handlers should be
 * reasonably quick.  If an event may trigger an extended process (such as a database load), spawn a thread or queue it
 * for later.
 *
 * <h2>Handler Methods</h2>
 * Event handler methods must accept only one argument: the event.
 *
 * <p>Handlers should not, in general, throw.  If they do, the bus will wrap the exception and
 * re-throw it.
 *
 * <h2>Producer Methods</h2>
 * Producer methods should accept no arguments and return their event type. When a subscriber is registered for a type
 * that a producer is also already registered for, the subscriber will be called with the return value from the
 * producer, provided it is not null.
 *
 * <h2>Dead Events</h2>
 * If an event is posted, but no registered handlers can accept it, it is considered "dead."  To give the system a
 * second chance to handle dead events, they are wrapped in an instance of {@link com.squareup.otto.DeadEvent} and
 * reposted.
