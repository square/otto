Otto - An event bus by Square
=============================

An enhanced Guava-based event bus with emphasis on Android support.

Otto is an event bus designed to decouple different parts of your application
while still allowing them to communicate efficiently.

Forked from Guava, Otto adds unique functionality to an already refined event
bus as well as specializing it to the Android platform.

*For usage instructions please see [the website][1].*
